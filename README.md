# CS-320_Course

About Portfolio for SNHU's CS-320 Software Test Automation &amp; QA, taken July - August 2022, focused on learning software engineering testing strategies and practices.

* How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? 

 By establishing a list of requirements and performing a proper analysis of what those requirements are and the needs of the requirements. Once the requirements are established, I regularly return to that list as I make progress through a project.  


* How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program? 

Establishing and following requirements is the best way to incorporate user needs into a program. However, establishing those requirements varies in techniques and strategies. Everything from competitor analysis to interviews, questionaries, focus groups, and many more strategies exist to help establish requirements. 

* How do I approach designing software? 

I may sound like a broken record, but requirements are the basis of how I approach a project. Requirements should guide every decision big or small. Understanding user needs and expectations are a major part of both the establishment and analysis of requirements. Each iteration of the project should include returning to those requirements and regular static testing of the project should include answering the questions: “Does this meet requirements? What does this add to meeting requirements?”
